# website

This a french website about a Maine Coon farming.

I'm beginner on GitHub and for porgram writing.

Thanks to people who want me to help to improve this website.

This website uses HTML/CSS and PHP actually.

If you clone the website you should download an image on the folder Pages/Images/Chats/name_cat.format before to add a cat, and when you add a cat you should enter the path of the image, so: Images/Chats/name_cat.format .
